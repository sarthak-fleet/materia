# Materia — PROJECT STATUS

Last updated: 2026-06-21

## Why / What

**Materia is "the Examine.com of the whole body."** A classy, ad-free, content-first reference
where you explore a layered human body, click any part, and find the herbs, supplements, chemicals,
and drugs that may help — each one **evidence-graded** and **linked to the studies behind it**.

The white space it fills: nobody joins interactive anatomy to evidence-graded, cited remedies.
BioDigital has the body but no remedies; Examine has the rigor but no body; NatMed has herb×drug
data but is paywalled/clinical. Materia is the join, built on a knowledge graph:
**body → condition → remedy → active compound → mechanism → study**, traversable from any direction.

**In scope:** interactive 2D layered explorer (3D-ready); per-entity content pages (body part,
condition, remedy, compound, study); evidence grading + study-level citations; search; the
differentiator moats (knowledge graph + first-class compounds, herb×drug safety checker,
tradition-vs-evidence overlay, evidence heatmap + comparisons, research-paper focus).

**Out of scope (now):** diagnosis, accounts/user data, e-commerce. A "where to find it" commerce
layer is **architecturally reserved but firewalled** from evidence — deferred until there is traffic.

**Not** a diagnosis tool, **not** medical advice, **not** sponsored. No ads, no affiliate links, no
supplement sales (also the lowest FTC-liability posture).

## Dependencies

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Framework | Astro 5 (`output: static`) |
| UI | Tailwind v4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`), Lightning CSS, lucide-react |
| Interactivity | React 19 islands (`@astrojs/react`) + nanostores |
| Content | Astro content collections + Zod + `reference()` |
| Search | client-side index + filter (Pagefind / embeddings planned) |
| Tooling | Biome 2.5, npm, Node 22 |
| Deploy | Cloudflare Pages (`pages_build_output_dir: dist`) |

External runtime deps: **none** (fully static). Content cites NCCIH, MSK About Herbs, NIH ODS,
Cochrane, PubMed. Anatomy art sources tracked in `ATTRIBUTIONS.md`.

Local dev: `npm install && npm run dev`. Build: `npm run build`. Checks: `npm run checks`.

The data model is the single source of truth: `src/content.config.ts` (six collections) +
`src/data/systems.ts` (layers). Graph joins live in `src/lib/graph.ts`.

| 2026-06-21 | **Bulk-import pipeline** (`scripts/import/`, public-domain APIs): PubChem → +30 compounds (CID-cited); openFDA → +44 drug reference stubs (curated class + checker risk-keywords). Caught & fixed openFDA combo-product class errors (metformin/lisinopril). No proprietary scraping; imported entities stay efficacy-free until curated |
| 2026-06-21 | Wired 13 curated **herb→drug interaction edges** into the imported drugs (bleeding: ginkgo/garlic/ginger/turmeric/fish-oil/vitamin-E → warfarin; SJW→warfarin CYP induction; vitamin-K2→warfarin antagonism; berberine→simvastatin; SAMe→sertraline serotonin; calcium→levothyroxine/cipro/doxycycline absorption) — safety checker now flags real herb×drug combos |

## Products

**Live:** not yet deployed. Target: `materia.pages.dev` → custom domain `materia.io`
(`askgalen.com` reserved as alt). Build output: `dist/` (**553 static pages**). Live deploy is behind
(last deploy = 426 pages); redeploy with `wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=materia`.

**Knowledge graph:** 24 body parts · 77 conditions (47 graded + 30 scaffolded stubs) · 207 remedies
(91 curated + 98 drug stubs + 18 herb stubs) · 60 compounds · 175 studies · 37 sources. **9 anatomy layers** as decimated Z-Anatomy
GLBs (~18 MB total) under `public/models/`. **All 24 body parts lead to cited content** (no orphans).

**Bulk-import pipeline** (`scripts/import/`, public-domain/CC0 only): `pubchem-compounds.mjs` (+30
compounds w/ CID), `openfda-drugs.mjs` (+44 drug stubs w/ curated class + checker risk keywords),
`wikidata-herbs.mjs` (+27 herb stubs w/ taxon QID, 10 linked to imported compounds). Imported
entities carry **no efficacy claims** — grading stays curated/verified. See `ATTRIBUTIONS.md`.
Proprietary DBs (Examine/NatMed) are NOT scraped — copyright + moat.

**Primary routes:** `/` (explorer) · `/part/[slug]` · `/condition/[slug]` · `/remedy/[slug]` ·
`/compound/[slug]` · `/study/[slug]` · `/conditions` · `/remedies` · `/compounds` · `/search` ·
`/checker` (safety) · `/methodology` · `/disclaimer` · `/about`.

## Features (shipped)

### Platform & deploy
- Astro 5 static, `format: file` (no trailing-slash redirects), inlined critical CSS.
- Tailwind v4 + Lightning CSS; Biome; Cloudflare Pages config; sitemap.

### Data model (the knowledge graph)
- Six cross-referenced collections with Zod schemas; `reference()` enforces integrity at build.
- **Every efficacy claim must cite ≥1 study/source** — enforced by `.nonempty()`; build fails otherwise.
- Active **compounds** modeled as first-class nodes; **studies** as first-class research nodes.
- Evidence grade A/B/C/D/insufficient, graded per remedy × condition; efficacy ⟂ safety.

### Explorer (3D)
- React island (react-three-fiber): loads the active layer's Z-Anatomy GLB; **true per-part mesh
  raycasting** (hover/click the real bone/muscle/organ) via a name→slug keyword map.
- **Hover everything** — every mesh lights up with a live cleaned label; highlight is imperative
  (O(1), no React re-render), label isolated to its own subscriber; recolor only on selection change.
- **Every structure clickable** — mapped regions toggle their slug (→ cited conditions in the panel);
  unmapped structures toggle by name and show as a "no data yet" card. Nothing is inert.
- **Multi-select** non-blocking side panel lists all selections (clear/remove); drag-rotate;
  **zoom-to-cursor/area** (wheel + +/− buttons, auto-spin pauses on interact); floating-label stripped.
- nanostores selection state decoupled from rendering; 2D SVG body is the fallback.
- **Layer toggle over all 9 systems**, each swapping to its own model.

### Entity pages & components
- Condition: affected parts, graded remedy list, red-flag banner, prose.
- Remedy: evidence-by-condition matrix with per-claim citations, compounds, safety, interactions,
  tradition-vs-evidence overlay, non-prescriptive "what was studied".
- Compound: mechanism + every remedy containing it. Study: structured facts + "cited by" back-links.
- Components: EvidenceBadge, CitationList, SafetyBlock, UseGuidance, TraditionOverlay, Disclaimer.

### Trust & safety
- Sitewide disclaimer banner + inline block on entity pages; red-flag gating on conditions.
- Citations show design/n/journal/PMID/DOI + accessed date. "Studied at…" framing, never doses.
- Deterministic client-side search over conditions/remedies/compounds/parts (+aliases).

### Content (verified, cited — aggregated, never claimed)
- Musculoskeletal: knee/hip/hand OA, low back pain, RA, DOMS, cramps, migraine, tension headache,
  gout, plantar fasciitis.
- Organ systems: hypertension, high cholesterol, NAFLD, GERD, IBS, constipation, insomnia, anxiety,
  common cold, kidney stones, thyroiditis.
- 23 conditions · 49 remedies · 56 studies · 37 sources — every efficacy claim cited (incl. honest
  *negatives*: glucosamine≠hip, CoQ10≠BP, vitamin C≠cold prevention, echinacea weak).
- "Aggregator, not authority" stated on `/methodology` + `/about`; ≥1 source per claim is build-enforced.

## Todo / Planned / Deferred / Blocked

### Planned (next)
1. Anatomy art pass — segmented, classy per-system SVG layers (muscular from MIT body-highlighter;
   skeletal/organs from Wikimedia CC-BY); posterior view + view toggle (unblocks lower-back in explorer).
2. **Safety checker** (`/checker`) — build a stack, flag interactions + shared-compound duplication.
3. **Evidence heatmap** — color body regions by aggregated grade.
4. **Semantic search** — Transformers.js + bge-small embeddings over the build-time index (retrieval
   only, never generation); symptom→body-part mapping; ⌘K command palette.
5. Comparison tables (remedy vs remedy for a condition). OG images + MedicalWebPage schema.
6. Breadth: more systems, conditions, and remedies beyond musculoskeletal.

### Deferred
- 3D renderer (`ThreeRenderer` via Z-Anatomy meshes) — abstraction in place, not built.
- Commerce / "where to find it" layer — reserved, firewalled from evidence, awaits traffic.

### Blocked / Known gaps
- `lower-back` body part is content-only (posterior view not yet drawn) — flagged by `npm run checks`.
- A few citations the seed research could not 100% verify are cited via their confirmed umbrella
  reference/DOI (menthol, comfrey individual RCTs) — see `docs/decision-log.md`.
